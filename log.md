**Today's Progress**: Updated knowledge from HTML 3 to HMTL 5, the big difference is the complexity of web forms are much more in depth!

Completed https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#basic-html-and-html5

Created a few VMs to work in instead of W10; fossaPup - too basic lots missing but so fast! Manjaro fantastic but slow in a VM, will create a multi boot scernario once settled on OS

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
